        <h3>
            My background
        </h3>
        <p class="body">
            I was born in Canton, Ohio (yes the Pro Football Hall of Fame), and raised in a small town called Bolivar.
            I went to the local school system there called Tusky Valley and eventually went to the local 
            vocational school called Buckeye Career Center. There I studied Information Technology and I graduated from there
            with a 3.2GPA and in the top 5 in the entire program. I learned a bit of everything from programming to network
            and infrastructure. After I graduated, I attended 3 semesters at Kent State Tuscarawas and majored in Business Administration, Mechanical
            Engineering, and welding before I had to leave school to work full-time. Over the years, I continued to learn and better myself in many different
            fields, including programming, photography, automotive, and business. I owned and operated an Auto Spa while living in Ohio as well just for something to 
            occupy my free time and make a little extra money.

        <h3>
            My Current Life
        </h3>
        <p class="body">
            After living in Ohio for 23 years, and dating my girlfriend, Jordyn, for 2.5 of them, I made the decision to move from my two stop light town
            in Ohio to Mobile, Alabama. I have been living here with Jordyn since April of 2022. Since then I have been working relentlessly to rebuild the 
            lifestyle I grew accustomed to back in Ohio while still trying to enjoy my life with her. As of now - I work at Academy Sports full-time and on
            the weekends I go to the car shows to take pictures! (That portfolio can be found <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/195422840@N03/" target="_blank">here</a> or
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/v2.photoguy/" target="_blank">here!</a>) During my off time from work, I work on projects such as this portfolio, going to the gym, or hanging out
            with my girlfriend. I dream of a life where we don't have to worry about paying bills and we can do just about anything we'd like, just about whenever we'd
            like to, but that day will come within time and effort.
